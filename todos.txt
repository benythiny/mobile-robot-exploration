x 1. fix path simplification -> Done. x and y coords were in wrong order ( I guess)
also I rewrote my algorithm buy the template from the web

x 2. only plan a new path when the previous one is already finished -> Done

x 3. only show feasible frontiers -> Done

4. fix collisions with objects that were not taken into
consideration while planning the path -> reactive goto?
x -> or simply check if there is collision between current position and next goal (bresen line)

x 5. stop the path if the frontier is not there anymore or is in obstacle

6. Fix rotations of the robot when it stands still

7. REWRITE goto(self, goal, odometry, collision) !

8. maybe after deceting the collision, remove this frontier and plan the path to another one.
On other hand, if it is not possible to plan the path, the next frontier would be considered

9. change constants! 

10. implement timeout for path simplification
